# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data to determine if a Citi Bike style business will work in Des Moines.

## Analysis
I looked at multiple factors to see the comparisons between New York and Des Moines.  We looked both cities' McDonald's locations, gender, age and temperature breakdowns.

### Where are the Citi Bikes used and do McDonald's stores have something to do with it?
While McDonald’s restaurants locations do not have a direct impact on the use of Citi Bikes being used, you can see a correlation.  Looking at the first two slides fo the story, you can see the typical starting and ending locations for Citi Bike users.  There is a concentration of users in Manhattan.  In this same area, there are a concentration of McDonald’s stores. This correlation shows there are more people in these areas who would be available to use City Bikes. In Des Moines, there are many McDonald’s but only a few clusters.  We want to focus our program in those areas. 

### What does Gender have to do with it? 
In New York, 47.7% of the residents were Male, according to the 2010 census.  However, 65.2% of the Citi Bike users were male.  When looking at Des Moines, the population is 49.2% male.  This increase in male residents compared to New York will help our chances to be more successful as it is shown that the typical clients are male.

### Average Age in Des Moines is Advantageous.
Does the age demographic in Des Moines support a Citi Bike program?  To answer this, we will look at the New York Citi Bike program.  The New York Citi Bike Program is majorly used by people between the ages of 24 and 34. 7.8% of residents in Des Moines are between the ages of 25 and 29 while 7.9% are between 30 and 34.  These are the two highest numbers out of all age ranges.  Most of the population being of these ages, it gives us a great chance to be successful starting this business.

### Weather Comparison
Will the Weather in Des Moines grant people a chance to use the bikes?  I wanted to compare the weather in August of 2019 in New York vs Des Moines to see if the weather would be too extreme to ride a bike.  I found the temperature in Des Moines to be more moderate than in New York during that time.  During the month of August, Des Moines has an average temperature of 72 degrees while New York was 76. 

## Conclusion  
In conclusion, the weather, age demographic, gender and density of McDonald’s all show that this bike sharing business will work in Des Moines.
